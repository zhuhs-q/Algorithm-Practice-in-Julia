# Algorithm-Practice-in-Julia
I am reading 'Algorithms' by Jeff Erickson, so I'd like to upload my practice on this repository.

## Recursion
### Practice(not exercise)
*  Hanoi Tower
*  Merge Sort
*  Quick Sort
*  (Quick Selection use recursion in a good way)

### Theory
*  How to prove correctness by induction Hypothesis?
*  How to calculate complexity by recursion tree?
*  The upper bound of efficiency of basic math operations (open)
